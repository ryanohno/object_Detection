# object_Detection

  Printorder = print0 funtion in order
  
1.import timeprint.py - generate timestamp in a text file

2.current_timeprint.py - print time.txt with subprocess. using LP command

3.imageprint.py - print image.png with subprocess. using LP command




1. Detect Py operates
from the begining, import printorder.py

2. when button pressed (waitkey)
    call the print0 funtion 



It prints! 
but very slow. so, I am afraid of people spamming the button.
